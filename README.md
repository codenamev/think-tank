# Think Tank

A distributed, author-partnered, knowledge base and retriever of published
content.  Books, papers, articles, podcasts, screencasts, whatever your medium,
we'll make it AI surface-able in the highest of quality for your needs.

## Plan

1. Author(s) broker a deal with ThinkTank.io to agree to provide per-use-access to their
   selected content at a set price, plus fractional network market.
2. User signs up for an account, and sets up Stripe connection for payments for their monthly access tier $/mo.
3. User creates their first book: 1) select the resources you want to include in the book, 2) selecting resources updates the cost figure for access to the running total of the resources selected.
4. User views Book they created, and guided to first Q&A session, with answers
   citing the resources of the book.
5. User guided on API access to their Book.
